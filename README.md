# A-multitask-learning-approach-for-building-energy-optimization-and-comfort-models

## Description
This project aims to develop a multitask optimization model that simultaneously addresses the comfort of individuals and energy use for more efficient energy consumption. This model will integrate various control strategies and optimization techniques to strike a balance between occupant comfort and energy efficiency. It will consist of a thermal comfort prediction model, a time series energy load prediction model, an occupancy model, and a general optimization model. By implementing this model, we hope to offer a solution that enhances the thermal comfort of building occupants while also reducing energy consumption
